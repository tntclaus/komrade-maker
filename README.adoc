= Komrade of Maker (universal CNC platform)

[.right]
.First prototype, build volume (mm) 580x580x580
image::docs/img/photo_km-5.8.jpeg["First prototype",360]

This design is universal platform, that uses where available affordable parts, primarily from Reprap project, 8 bit realtime controllers, RPi 3/4 and Klipper.

Primary characteristics by application:

* 3D printing:
** Enclosed chamber passively heated up to 80ºC;
** Filament motion control;
** Auto bed levelling with Piezo Sensor and triple z axis;
** X/Y Linear speeds up to 200 mm/s (or greater with proper voltage/servos);
** Ceramic build surface.
* Milling with 585 series motors:
** Soft materials, e.g.: sheet plastics, plywood, aluminium (not tested);
** PCB prototyping.
* Laser cutting/engraving.
* Electrochemical machining.
